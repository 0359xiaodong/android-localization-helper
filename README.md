# Android Localization Helper

Helps to find missing or obsolete translations for android resources.

## Build

Use `sbt` to build project:

    sbt stage

This will build jar and create distribution with all required dependencies and an executable shell script under `target/universal/stage` directory.

## Usage:

`alh` is a thin wrapper around executable generated by `sbt-native-packager` plugin

    alh /path/to/android/project [arrays.xml]

You must specify android project folder.
Second parameter is optional, it specifies resources filename (strings.xml by default).

### Example:

    git clone git://github.com/4e6/android-localization-helper.git
    cd android-localization-helper
    ./sbt stage
    ./alh /path/to/android/project

## Output:

    [filename]
     *[resource type]
      *[T] [resource name]
      *[O] [resource name]

* `[T]` Resources need to be translated (exists in original xml but not in localized version)
* `[O]` Obsolete resources (exists in localized version but not in original one)
